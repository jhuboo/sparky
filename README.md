## Background

During the COVID-19 pandemic, faced with solitary confinement, our team decided to build a quadruped pet robot that would keep us company. We began our journey through the XCC class challenge at Boston University, and are developing the robot over the course of Fall 2021 & Spring 2022.

## Usage

This project uses the Raspberry Pi 4 2GB model with Buster 64-bit architecture underneath. Most of the code is written in Python 3. 

Additional hardware required can be found under the hardware directory.

See the requirements.txt file for a list of python dependencies which can be installed with pip
using the command:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
